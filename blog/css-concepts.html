  <h1>The proper usage of margin, border, and padding in CSS</h1>
  <h2>1/15/2016</h2>
  

  <article>
  	<p>
		The correct usage of margins, borders, and padding is critical in css design. They can help make a website look more professional by adding the correct spacing between context on the page. Before explaining how these are used in designing a website, let's start by defining the properties.

		<ul>
			<li>The <span class="underline">Border</span> properties allows you to add a border around the element on the page as well as add border styling properties so it fits the design of the page.</li>
			<li>The <span class="underline">Margin</span> properties adjusts the white space<span class="italic"> outside</span> of the border around an element.</li>
			<li>The <span class="underline">Padding</span> properties adjust the white space<span class="italic"> inside</span> of the border around an element.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Each of these properties are integral to create an appealing, easy to navigate page. By including these properties into the CSS stylesheet, one can add consistent spacing in elements like a navigation bar on a website.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the navigation bar example above, you can see the three properties (margin, border, and padding) all being used to create evenly spaced links. This was done by giving each link the same border properties on the stylesheet. The CSS code that was used to achieve these boxes were 2 separate code lines. The first being: “border: 2px solid black”. This created the border around the link by giving it the properties of a 2 pixel thick, solid, black line. The second code being: “border-radius: 5px”. This created the rounded edges on the corners of the border.
	</p>

	<p>
		To space the borders equal distances from each other Margin was used. In the case of this navigation bar the css code used was “margin: 5px”. This gives each border a margin of 5 pixel on each side (top,bottom, right, and left) outside of the border.
	</p>

	<p>
		For the spacing between the link and the border the css code used was “padding: 10px”. This gives even spacing around the link and the border of 10 pixels on each side (top,bottom, right, and left).
	</p>

	<p>
		There are additional css properties that can be added to further refine the navigation bar in this example but by just using margin, border, and padding the above look was achieved.
