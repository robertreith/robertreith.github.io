        In this post Iâ€™m going to reflect on building my first website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating my first website from the ground up has been an amazing experience. The fact that just 9 weeks ago (begining of January 2016) I had no prior knowledge of anything coding related and now I have an operational multi-page site is something I am extremely proud of. I made the choice to make a career change to something I felt I would enjoy and every day that goes by I feel that I have made the right decision. Being able to see the hard work and long hours turn into something tangible that I created is a great feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process required to get my site to its current point was not an easy one. It took many hours to determine what the layout should look like, how to navigate best around the page, and what was in the end just visually appealing (in my opinion). As the weeks have gone by my skills with HTML and CSS have vastly improved, although I would still consider myself a beginner, I can take the concepts in my head and in practice get pretty close without needing to do much research anymore. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I now look at websites differently when surfing the web. When I come across something I like, I take a quick look at the source code to become familiar with a new way of doing things. I constantly want to keep expanding my knowledge so I can be able to deliver the best product possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting to the point I am now has not been the easiest path but with the structure given by DevBootcamp the task of learning something new was less daunting. I am excited to see what my new future holds.
