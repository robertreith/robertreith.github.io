  <h1>The basics about version control, Git, and Github</h1>

      Version control has many benefits to a developer. Version control records all the changes made to a file over time. This allows you to go back to a previous version if needed. Version control is critical for collaborative projects. It allows multiple people to work on the same file without stepping on eachother's toes or worse overwriting someone else’s changes. After everyone completes their portion, it can all be merged together into the master file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git helps you keep track of your changes throughout the lifecycle of your project. Git does this by viewing the project as a “tree”. By doing this it allows you to create “branches” on that tree. The branches are a current file or group of files you’re working on. you can work on the file or files without affecting the “trunk” of the tree. Once you are happy with the files and believe they will not ruin the trunk, you can add them in.
    </p>
    <p>
        You use Github to store your code because it allows you to backup your repositories to the website that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. This also allows multiple people to work on the same project and merge all their work together.
