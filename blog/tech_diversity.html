  <h1>Diversity in the Tech Industry</h1>
  <h2>1/23/2016</h2>

  <article>
      <p>
         There are many issues facing the tech industry today. One of the most prevalent issues is diversity. The current demographic makeup is primarily white and Asian males. 
      </p>

      <p>
         There is a misconception that the lack of diversity is due to there not being enough qualified women and minorities to fill the positions. This is not true, the real reason for the lack of diversity is culture. Companies cannot just set diversity goals that they want to reach, but must address the current culture in the workforce. 
      </p>

      <p>
          Companies should be focusing on addressing “the old way of thinking” and give employee training which will show employees why this thinking is wrong and provide proactive ways to change the culture. This will help address the issues of women and minorities not feeling welcome in the workforce.
      </p>

      <p>
          By addressing the issue of lack of diversity in the workforce, it will not only help promote a better work experience for all people, but it will also make a better user experience because there will be a broader perspective from employees.
