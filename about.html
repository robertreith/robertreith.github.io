      <p>
        My Name is Bobby and as they say in Dev Bootcamp, I am here "to build beautiful and meaningful things"!
      </p>
      <p>
        After college I fell into the typical office setting, working 9 to 5 punching the clock. A few years had passed and I felt it was time for a change. From the tragedy that was Hurricane Sandy, I found myself wanting to help people in my community that were devastated by the storm. I was able to land a position as a case manager for the state run program to help homeowners get back on their feet and rebuild. The portion of the contract I was working on came to an end and I made the decision I wanted to stick with doing meaningful work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always been drawn to the the tech industry and fascinated by people's ability to create meaningful things from the ground up. After some serious research, I chose to dive into the tech industry head first and the best way I found to do this was to fully immerse myself into Dev Bootcamp. Eager to learn and my mind open to absorbing as much information and technical ability as possible, the journey has been an amazing, eye opening experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyday my skillset is growing and everyday I am one step closer to achieving my goal of being able to help people create, build, and maintain their visions in the virtual world we live in today.
